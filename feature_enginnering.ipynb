        "\n",
        "2. Correlation measures the relationship between two variables—how one changes in response to the other.\n",

        "3. Negative correlation means when one variable increases, the other decreases.\n",

        "5. Loss value shows how far off predictions are from actual results. Lower loss means a better model.\n",

        "6. Continuous variables are numeric and infinite (e.g., age), while categorical variables are distinct groups (e.g., gender).\n",

        "7. Categorical variables are handled using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.\n",
